This study examines sports fans' perceptions of Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) technology in baseball, focusing on its impact on the perceived authenticity of the game. By analyzing 225 Reddit posts and 8,529 comments through topic modeling, sentiment, and thematic analysis, three core themes emerged: nostalgic authenticity, procedural authenticity, and community authenticity. Fans' views on ABS reflect a tension between embracing technological advancement and preserving traditional elements of the sport. This nuanced reconciliation shapes whether fans accept or resist ABS, contributing valuable insight into the evolving role of technology in sports and its effect on fan engagement and authenticity.
