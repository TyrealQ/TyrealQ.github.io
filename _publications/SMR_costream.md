An emerging form of social media service, social live streaming, has been increasingly adopted by sports organizations to foster fan engagement. The National Football League (NFL) is no exception to this trend as it collaborates with Twitch, one of the most popular live streaming platforms, to broadcast Thursday Night Football (TNF). By leveraging Twitchâ€™s video game personalities (streamers), the new format of sports live streaming, also known as co-streaming, allows the co-creation of TNF experience characterized by personalized commentary and ample socialization opportunities. Given the novel partnership, the current study drew from service-dominant logic (S-D logic) to examine the relationships among co-streamer expertise, co-streamer identification, co-streaming fit, virtual interactions, and continuous watching intentions. Results obtained from an empirical study on 2019 TNF co-streaming showed that both co-streaming fit and virtual interactions positively impacted continuous watching intentions. More importantly, co-streaming fit mediated the effects of co-streamer expertise and viewer identification on behavioral proclivities. Among highly identified viewers, co-streamer expertise had a greater impact on co-streaming fit. Findings gleaned from this study broadened the applicability of S-D logic and advanced the understanding of value co-creation in sports live streaming.
