excerpt: Introducing [a transformative online learning experience](https://youtu.be/HpOOvWrgiGM) that takes an in-depth look at highly engaged, yet negatively received NFL Instagram posts featuring Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. By analyzing this real-world case study, students will uncover valuable insights on how celebrity-athlete crossovers can face backlash if perceived as prioritizing fame over the sport, as well as strategies for striking the right balance between sports and culture on social media.

This [online learning experience](https://youtu.be/HpOOvWrgiGM) covers an interesting case study on highly engaging yet negatively received NFL Instagram posts from the 2023 season, featuring Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. By analyzing this real-world example, students will have the opportunity to gain valuable insights about how celebrity-athlete crossovers can face backlash if they're perceived as prioritizing fame over the sport itself.

But the learning doesn’t stop there. I’ve designed an interactive activity at the end where students can put their newfound knowledge to the test. Using the COSTAR framework, they’ll create and refine their own original Instagram post concept that blends sports and pop culture in an engaging and authentic way.

As someone who is passionate about teaching and making research more accessible, I’m really proud of this innovative content. My goal is to create learning experiences that are not only informative, but also fun and relevant to students’ interests. After all, the most impactful education happens when we can connect the material to things people truly care about.
