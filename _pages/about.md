Welcome! I'm Ty, also known as Dr. Q, an [Assistant Professor of Sport Management at Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/chse/kinesiology/faculty_listing/qian.php). Outside of work, I cherish a joyful life with my wife, Tracy. We share our passions, celebrate special moments, and find meaning in the beauty of everyday life.

## Research Interests

My research bridges service marketing and digital communication through a post-positivist lens, examining consumer experiences and interactions across both traditional and digital channels, with particular focus on sports and esports environments. Through artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV)—I analyze unstructured data from these diverse channels to advance our understanding of modern service ecosystems and digital transformation.

## Open Resource Space

I manage knowledge spaces in three key areas:

- Sport Management Research: Research insights into consumer psychology and behavior in sports and esports, the impact of gamification on social live streaming, and the dynamics of user-generated content (UGC), while simultaneously developing accessible teaching frameworks that translate research findings into inclusive learning experiences and democratize knowledge across diverse communities.
- NLP Applications: Large language model (LLM) integrations for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), BERTopic modeling, and word embeddings.
- Models & Datasets: Curated collection of reviews, social media content, and fine-tuned LLMs.
